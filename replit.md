# BENIUS - Multi-Tenant School Management System

## Overview
A full-stack, enterprise-grade school management platform with:
- **Super Admin** (`/super-master`) — school provisioning
- **Principal/Admin Dashboard** (`/admin-dashboard`) — Navy & Gold Command Center with 15 tiles, Live Pulse analytics, server-side pagination for 5000+ students
- **Teacher Dashboard** (`/teacher-dashboard`) — 13-module grid with glassmorphic EdTech UI
- **Student Portal** — activation, login, digital ID card

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Wouter (routing), TanStack React Query, recharts
- **Backend**: Express.js, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, bcryptjs, express-session + connect-pg-simple, multer
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Project Structure
- `shared/schema.ts` — All Drizzle table definitions, insert schemas, and inferred types
- `server/db.ts` — Database connection (pool + drizzle)
- `server/storage.ts` — `DatabaseStorage` class: all CRUD methods, paginated queries, audit log writer
- `server/routes.ts` — Admin API routes (schools, students, principals, school metadata, bulk CSV import)
- `server/teacher-routes.ts` — Teacher + admin extra routes (auth, attendance, homework, classwork, notices, complaints, exams, gallery, calendar, library, leave, timetable, student leaves, visitor logs, audit logs, paginated students/teachers)
- `server/index.ts` — Express server, session middleware, static file serving (`/uploads`)
- `client/src/hooks/use-school-config.ts` — Shared hook for school metadata (classes, sections, subjects, exam_types) with fallback
- `client/src/pages/` — Page components (home, super-master, login, admin-dashboard, register, student-login, student-dashboard, teacher-login, teacher-dashboard)
- `client/src/pages/teacher-modules/` — 13 teacher sub-module pages

## Admin Dashboard — Navy & Gold Command Center
- **Theme**: bg=#0A1628, cards=#1A2942, gold=#D4AF37
- **Live Pulse Header**: Total Students · Faculty Strength · Daily Presence % · Action Required (red badge)
- **15 tiles in 4 groups**:
  - Foundation: School Setup, Student Registry, Faculty Mapping, Approval Center
  - Oversight: Audit Logs, Visitor Log, Attendance Overview, Performance Analytics
  - Management: Exam Controller, Complaint Hub, Noticeboard, Timetable Master
  - Enterprise: ID Card Gen, Assets Inventory, (expandable)
- **Student Registry**: debounced search + Class/Section filters + server-side pagination (LIMIT 50, OFFSET)
- **Approval Center**: teacher leave, student leave, gallery images, e-book verifications — all pending items
- **Visitor Log**: check-in form + check-out PATCH, audit trail
- **Audit Logs**: chronological trail of all approve/reject/upload/checkin actions

## Teacher Dashboard — 13 Modules
1. **Profile** — personal info
2. **Attendance** — mark/edit, 7-day window, history table
3. **Homework** — social-feed cards, view tracking, file upload, due dates
4. **Classwork** — lesson log (mirrors homework, no due date)
5. **Noticeboard** — smart targeting (section/class/school), 5+ notice types
6. **Complaint** — Discipline & Resolution Hub, ticketing, live search, resolution threads
7. **Examination** — spreadsheet grid, Tab-key nav, dual-line recharts, 360° history
8. **Gallery** — batch upload (≤10 images), event tag, masonry grid, lightbox
9. **Faculty Info** — staff directory
10. **Calendar** — Month/Week toggle, holiday=red/academic=blue/event=green, today highlight, popovers
11. **Library** — catalog search, e-book upload (PDF/EPUB → pending verification), borrow/return, my books
12. **Leave** — My Leave (Sick/Casual/Earned balance cards, apply form, history) + Student Leave Requests tab (approve→auto-marks attendance, forward to principal)
13. **Timetable** — weekly schedule grid

## Multi-Tenant Security
- Admin metadata routes enforce `userRole === "admin"`
- Teacher endpoints require `req.session.teacherId`
- School ownership verified on all queries (`WHERE school_id = session.schoolId`)
- Gallery upload routes verify teacher school ownership
- Leave balance locked to own teacherId
- Student leave routes verify assigned class/section match
- Book verify route checks admin-school ownership
- Paginated admin routes verify `req.session.schoolId === params.schoolId`

## Multi-Tenant School Config
- Principal configures master lists via School Settings tile
- 4 keys: `classes`, `sections`, `subjects`, `exam_types` (stored as JSON in school_metadata)
- `useSchoolConfig(schoolId)` hook provides dynamic dropdowns with fallback defaults
- All modules use dynamic config; fallback if empty: classes (L.K.G–12), sections (A–E), exam types (UT1–Annual)

## Leave & Attendance Sync
- Teacher approve student leave → PATCH `/api/student-leaves/:id/approve` → marks attendance as "leave" for each date in range (skips Sundays)
- Teacher forward → status = "forwarded" (goes to principal approval in Approval Center)
- Admin approve student leave → same auto-attendance sync
- Teacher leave balance: `GET /api/leave/balance/:teacherId` → counts days used per type for current year

## Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/teacher-login`, `GET /api/teacher-me`, `POST /api/teacher-logout`
- `GET /api/attendance/:schoolId/:class/:section/:date`, `POST /api/attendance`
- `GET|POST /api/homework/:schoolId/:class/:section`, `PATCH|DELETE /api/homework/:id`
- `GET|POST /api/gallery/:schoolId`, `POST /api/gallery/batch` (multer array ≤10)
- `POST /api/library/ebooks` (multer single, teacher e-book upload)
- `PATCH /api/library/books/:id/verify` (admin)
- `GET /api/student-leaves/:schoolId/:class/:section`, `PATCH /api/student-leaves/:id/approve`, `PATCH /api/student-leaves/:id/forward`
- `GET /api/leave/balance/:teacherId`
- `GET /api/calendar/:schoolId`, `POST /api/calendar`, `DELETE /api/calendar/:id`
- `GET|POST /api/visitor-logs`, `GET /api/visitor-logs/:schoolId`, `PATCH /api/visitor-logs/:id/checkout`
- `GET /api/audit-logs/:schoolId`
- `GET /api/schools/:schoolId/students/paginated?q=&cls=&section=&page=` (LIMIT 50)
- `GET /api/schools/:schoolId/teachers/paginated?q=&page=` (LIMIT 50)

## Global Standards
- Date format: dd/mm/yyyy (`toLocaleDateString("en-GB")`) across entire app
- All interactive elements have `data-testid` attributes
- Glassmorphic EdTech card aesthetic throughout teacher modules
- recharts for all analytics charts

## Running
- `npm run dev` — starts Express backend + Vite frontend on port 5000
- `npm run db:push` — sync Drizzle schema to PostgreSQL (never use db:push interactively; use direct SQL for new tables when needed)
